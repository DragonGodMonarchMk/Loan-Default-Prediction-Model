# Loan-Default-Prediction-Model
Loan default prediction is a technique used in finance to assess the likelihood that a borrower will fail to repay a loan [1, 2, 3]. By analyzing borrower data, lenders can make informed decisions about loan approvals, interest rates, and loan terms [1, 4].

Here's a simplified overview of the process:

Data Collection: Lenders gather historical loan data including credit scores, employment history, and repayment history [1, 3].
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and formatted for analysis [1].
Model Training: Machine learning algorithms are trained on the data to identify patterns and relationships between borrower characteristics and defaults [1, 4].
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed to ensure its accuracy in predicting defaults [5].
Loan Application Scoring: New loan applications are scored based on the developed model to predict the likelihood of default [1].

There are several Machine Learning models used to predict loan defaults, some of the most common include:

Logistic Regression: A statistical method that analyzes the relationship between borrower characteristics and loan default [5, 6] [NUMBER: https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Predicting-Loan-Default-Using-Machine-Learning NUMBER: https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/8k71nk666].
Decision Trees: A tree-like model that classifies loan applications based on a series of borrower characteristics [3, 4] [NUMBER: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=120102 NUMBER: [invalid URL removed]].
Ensemble Methods: More advanced models that combine multiple models like Decision Trees or Random Forest to improve overall accuracy [2, 3] [NUMBER: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666764923000218 NUMBER: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=120102].
These models are trained on historical loan data to identify patterns and relationships between borrower attributes and defaults. Once a model is trained, it can be used to score new loan applications and predict the likelihood of default.
