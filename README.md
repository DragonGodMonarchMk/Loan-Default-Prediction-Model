# Loan-Default-Prediction-Model
Loan default prediction is a technique used in finance to assess the likelihood that a borrower will fail to repay a loan [1, 2, 3]. By analyzing borrower data, lenders can make informed decisions about loan approvals, interest rates, and loan terms [1, 4].

Here's a simplified overview of the process:

Data Collection: Lenders gather historical loan data including credit scores, employment history, and repayment history [1, 3].
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and formatted for analysis [1].
Model Training: Machine learning algorithms are trained on the data to identify patterns and relationships between borrower characteristics and defaults [1, 4].
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed to ensure its accuracy in predicting defaults [5].
Loan Application Scoring: New loan applications are scored based on the developed model to predict the likelihood of default [1].

There are several Machine Learning models used to predict loan defaults, some of the most common include:

Logistic Regression: A statistical method that analyzes the relationship between borrower characteristics and loan default [5, 6] [NUMBER: https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Predicting-Loan-Default-Using-Machine-Learning NUMBER: https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/8k71nk666].
Decision Trees: A tree-like model that classifies loan applications based on a series of borrower characteristics [3, 4] [NUMBER: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=120102 NUMBER: [invalid URL removed]].
Ensemble Methods: More advanced models that combine multiple models like Decision Trees or Random Forest to improve overall accuracy [2, 3] [NUMBER: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666764923000218 NUMBER: https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=120102].
These models are trained on historical loan data to identify patterns and relationships between borrower attributes and defaults. Once a model is trained, it can be used to score new loan applications and predict the likelihood of default.

## üìå Background & Motivation

Loan default poses a significant financial risk to lenders. Effective risk assessment enables banks and fintech platforms to make informed approval decisions and adjust interest rates. This project demonstrates a reproducible machine learning pipeline‚Äîfrom raw loan data to deployment-ready predictive model‚Äîwith transparent metrics and methodology.

## Dataset

‚öôÔ∏è *Note: Replace this placeholder with your actual dataset name, source URL, and relevant details.*

- **Graph-like historical** loan data including borrower demographics, credit history, loan characteristics (e.g. amount, term, interest rate).
- **Target variable**: `default` flag‚Äî1 for defaulted, 0 for repaid.
- **Data size**: N ‚âà _xx_, features: F ‚âà _yy_.

*(This repo currently includes Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling; update dataset info accordingly.)*

---

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook **`Loan Default Prediction EDA.ipynb`** ($\approx$Notebook 1) contains:

- Distribution and imbalance checks.
- Outlier detection (IQR, log-scaling, z-score).
- Correlation heatmaps and feature target‚Äêdependency plots.
- Insights flagged from features like income/debt ratio, employment duration, credit inquiries.

This guided feature cleaning and informed the modeling strategy.

---

## üß† Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Steps executed include:

- Handling missing values (`.dropna()`, median/mean for numericals, mode for categoricals).
- Encoding categorical variables using **LabelEncoder** or custom ordinal mappings.
- Binning skewed continuous variables (e.g. **DEBTINC**, **CLAGE**, **LoanAmount**).
- Addressing class imbalance using **RandomOverSampler** or **SMOTE**.
- Feature scaling via **StandardScaler**, as applicable.

These preprocessing steps were integrated into both notebooks for consistency.

## üîç Modeling Workflow

The notebook **`Loan Defaulter Predictor with Models.ipynb`** (Notebook 2) oversaw:

1. Splitting into train and test sets (typically 70:30), with stratification on default.
2. Training and evaluating classifiers:
   - **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì baseline interpretable model.
   - **Decision Tree Classifier** ‚Äì fast interpretable hierarchy.
   - **Random Forest** ‚Äì for ensemble robustness.
   - (**Optional**) **XGBoost** ‚Äì for high performance.
3. Hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV` / `RandomizedSearchCV`.
4. Comparing models using cross-validated **ROC-AUC**, **Recall**, **Precision**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.
5. Persisting the final model with `joblib.dump(...)` for reproducible use.

The chosen final model achieved strong predictive performance while balancing recall (to minimize false negatives) and overall accuracy.

## üìà Evaluation & Results

- **Final model** (e.g. Random Forest or XGBoost) selected by highest ROC-AUC and F1-score.
- Confusion matrices and classification reports included.
- Feature importance visualized via bar charts.
- Threshold-based analysis shows trade-offs between false positives and negatives.

*(Insert actual scores here ‚Äî e.g., ROC-AUC = 0.88, recall = 0.82, F1-score = 0.80.)*
